### Grbl_ESP32_R (CNC Controller) For ESP32 and CNCR (Rotary Table Gui)

[Grbl_ESP32_R](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/Grbl_Esp32_R) is a fork of [Grbl_ESP32](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32). It is modified to support push messages, an upcoming feature of [CNCR](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/CNCR), so that the rotary table can also be controlled using (4) buttons connected to the [Grbl_ESP32_R](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/Grbl_Esp32_R) controller.

Fore more information about the changes and the setup of the pushmessages, read the [WiKi](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/Grbl_Esp32_R/wiki). For all other information read the [Grbl_ESP32 WiKi](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32/wiki).
