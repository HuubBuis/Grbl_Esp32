### Grbl_ESP32_R (CNC Controller) for ESP32 and CNCR (Rotary Table GUI)

[Grbl_ESP32_R](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/Grbl_Esp32_R) is a fork of [Grbl_ESP32](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32). It is modified to support push messages, a new feature of rotary table GUI [CNCR](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/CNCR). Using push messages, [CNCR](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/CNCR) can also be controlled using (4) macro buttons connected to the [Grbl_ESP32_R](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/Grbl_Esp32_R) controller.

The [WiKi](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/Grbl_Esp32_R/wiki) covers information about code changes, compiling and the setup of macro buttons to control [CNCR](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/CNCR). For all other information read the [Grbl_ESP32 WiKi](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32/wiki).
